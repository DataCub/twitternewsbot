    "contents" : "\"Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art-- \n Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night\n And watching, with eternal lids apart,\n Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,\n The moving waters at their priestlike task\n Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,\n Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask\n Of snow upon the mountains and the moors--\n No--yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,\n Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,\n To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,\n Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,\n Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,\n And so live ever--or else swoon to death. \n When I have fears that I may cease to be \n Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,\n Before high-piled books, in charactery,\n Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain;\n When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,\n Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,\n And think that I may never live to trace\n Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;\n And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,\n That I shall never look upon thee more,\n Never have relish in the faery power\n Of unreflecting love;--then on the shore\n Of the wide world I stand alone, and think\n Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.\n Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,\n Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;\n Conspiring with him how to load and bless\n With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;\n To bend with apples the mossed cottage-trees,\n And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;\n To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells\n With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,\n And still more, later flowers for the bees,\n Until they think warm days will never cease,\n For Summer has o'er-brimmed their clammy cell.\n Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?\n Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find\n Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,\n Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;\n Or on a half-reaped furrow sound asleep,\n Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook\n Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers;\n And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep\n Steady thy laden head across a brook;\n Or by a cider-press, with patient look,\n Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.\n Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?\n Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,---\n While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,\n And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;\n Then in a wailful choir, the small gnats mourn\n Among the river sallows, borne aloft\n Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;\n And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;\n Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft\n The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,\n And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.\n How many bards gild the lapses of time!\n A few of them have ever been the food\n Of my delighted fancy,—I could brood\n Over their beauties, earthly, or sublime:\n And often, when I sit me down to rhyme,\n These will in throngs before my mind intrude:\n But no confusion, no disturbance rude\n Do they occasion; 'tis a pleasing chime.\n So the unnumbered sounds that evening store;\n The songs of birds—the whispering of the leaves— \n The voice of waters—the great bell that heaves\n With solemn sound,—and thousand others more,\n That distance of recognizance bereaves,\n Makes pleasing music, and not wild uproar.\n Lo! I must tell a tale of chivalry; \n For large white plumes are dancing in mine eye. \n Not like the formal crest of latter days: \n But bending in a thousand graceful ways; \n So graceful, that it seems no mortal hand, \n Or e’en the touch of Archimago’s wand, \n Could charm them into such an attitude. \n We must think rather, that in playful mood, \n Some mountain breeze had turned its chief delight, \n To show this wonder of its gentle might. \n Lo! I must tell a tale of chivalry; \n For while I muse, the lance points slantingly \n Athwart the morning air: some lady sweet, \n Who cannot feel for cold her tender feet, \n From the worn top of some old battlement \n Hails it with tears, her stout defender sent: \n And from her own pure self no joy dissembling, \n Wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling. \n Sometimes, when the good Knight his rest would take, \n It is reflected, clearly, in a lake, \n With the young ashen boughs, ’gainst which it rests, \n And th’ half seen mossiness of linnets’ nests.\n Ah! shall I ever tell its cruelty, \n When the fire flashes from a warrior’s eye, \n And his tremendous hand is grasping it, \n And his dark brow for very wrath is knit? \n Or when his spirit, with more calm intent, \n Leaps to the honors of a tournament, \n And makes the gazers round about the ring \n Stare at the grandeur of the ballancing? \n No, no! this is far off:—then how shall I \n Revive the dying tones of minstrelsy, \n Which linger yet about lone gothic arches, \n In dark green ivy, and among wild larches? \n How sing the splendour of the revelries, \n When but[t]s of wine are drunk off to the lees? \n And that bright lance, against the fretted wall, \n Beneath the shade of stately banneral, \n Is slung with shining cuirass, sword, and shield? \n Where ye may see a spur in bloody field. \n Light-footed damsels move with gentle paces \n Round the wide hall, and show their happy faces; \n Or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens: \n Like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens. \n Yet must I tell a tale of chivalry: \n Or wherefore comes that knight so proudly by? \n Wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight, \n Rein in the swelling of his ample might? \n Spenser! thy brows are arched, open, kind, \n And come like a clear sun-rise to my mind; \n And always does my heart with pleasure dance, \n When I think on thy noble countenance: \n Where never yet was ought more earthly seen \n Than the pure freshness of thy laurels green. \n Therefore, great bard, I not so fearfully \n Call on thy gentle spirit to hover nigh \n My daring steps: or if thy tender care, \n Thus startled unaware, \n Be jealous that the foot of other wight \n Should madly follow that bright path of light \n Trac’d by thy lov’d Libertas; he will speak, \n And tell thee that my prayer is very meek; \n That I will follow with due reverence, \n And start with awe at mine own strange pretence. \n Him thou wilt hear; so I will rest in hope \n To see wide plains, fair trees and lawny slope: \n The morn, the eve, the light, the shade, the flowers; \n Clear streams, smooth lakes, and overlooking towers.\n Read me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud\n Upon the top of Nevis, blind in mist!\n I look into the chasms, and a shroud\n Vapourous doth hide them, -- just so much I wist\n Mankind do know of hell; I look o'erhead,\n And there is sullen mist, -- even so much\n Mankind can tell of heaven; mist is spread\n Before the earth, beneath me, -- even such,\n Even so vague is man's sight of himself!\n Here are the craggy stones beneath my feet,--\n Thus much I know that, a poor witless elf,\n I tread on them, -- that all my eye doth meet\n Is mist and crag, not only on this height,\n But in the world of thought and mental might! \n Not Aladdin magian \n Ever such a work began; \n Not the wizard of the Dee \n Ever such a dream could see; \n Not St. John, in Patmos' Isle, \n In the passion of his toil, \n When he saw the churches seven, \n Golden aisl'd, built up in heaven, \n Gaz'd at such a rugged wonder. \n As I stood its roofing under \n Lo! I saw one sleeping there, \n On the marble cold and bare. \n While the surges wash'd his feet, \n And his garments white did beat. \n Drench'd about the sombre rocks, \n On his neck his well-grown locks, \n Lifted dry above the main, \n Were upon the curl again. \n 'What is this? and what art thou?' \n Whisper'd I, and touch'd his brow; \n 'What art thou? and what is this?' \n Whisper'd I, and strove to kiss \n The spirit's hand, to wake his eyes; \n Up he started in a trice: \n 'I am Lycidas,' said he, \n 'Fam'd in funeral minstrely! \n This was architectur'd thus \n By the great Oceanus!--\n Here his mighty waters play \n Hollow organs all the day; \n Here by turns his dolphins all, \n Finny palmers great and small, \n Come to pay devotion due--\n Each a mouth of pearls must strew. \n Many a mortal of these days, \n Dares to pass our sacred ways, \n Dares to touch audaciously \n This Cathedral of the Sea! \n I have been the pontiff-priest \n Where the waters never rest, \n Where a fledgy sea-bird choir \n Soars for ever; holy fire \n I have hid from mortal man; \n Proteus is my Sacristan. \n But the dulled eye of mortal \n Hath pass'd beyond the rocky portal; \n So for ever will I leave \n Such a taint, and soon unweave \n All the magic of the place.\n High-mindedness, a jealousy for good,\n A loving-kindness for the great man's fame,\n Dwells here and there with people of no name,\n In noisome alley, and in pathless wood:\n And where we think the truth least understood,\n Oft may be found a 'singleness of aim,'\n That ought to frighten into hooded shame\n A money-mongering, pitiable brood.\n How glorious this affection for the cause\n Of steadfast genius, toiling gallantly!\n What when a stout unbending champion awes\n Envy and malice to their native sty?\n Unnumbered souls breathe out a still applause,\n Proud to behold him in his country's eye.\n Oft have you seen a swan superbly frowning, \n And with proud breast his own white shadow crowning; \n He slants his neck beneath the waters bright \n So silently, it seems a beam of light \n Come from the galaxy: anon he sports,--\n With outspread wings the Naiad Zephyr courts, \n Or ruffles all the surface of the lake \n In striving from its crystal face to take \n Some diamond water drops, and them to treasure \n In milky nest, and sip them off at leisure. \n But not a moment can he there insure them, \n Nor to such downy rest can he allure them; \n For down they rush as though they would be free, \n And drop like hours into eternity. \n Just like that bird am I in loss of time, \n Whene'er I venture on the stream of rhyme; \n With shatter'd boat, oar snapt, and canvass rent, \n I slowly sail, scarce knowing my intent; \n Still scooping up the water with my fingers, \n In which a trembling diamond never lingers.\n By this, friend Charles, you may full plainly see \n Why I have never penn’d a line to thee: \n Because my thoughts were never free, and clear, \n And little fit to please a classic ear; \n Because my wine was of too poor a savour \n For one whose palate gladdens in the flavour \n Of sparkling Helicon:--small good it were \n To take him to a desert rude, and bare, \n Who had on Baiae's shore reclin'd at ease, \n While Tasso's page was floating in a breeze \n That gave soft music from Armida's bowers, \n Mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers: \n Small good to one who had by Mulla's stream \n Fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream; \n Who had beheld Belphoebe in a brook, \n And lovely Una in a leafy nook, \n And Archimago leaning o'er his book: \n Who had of all that's sweet tasted, and seen, \n From silv'ry ripple, up to beauty's queen; \n From the sequester'd haunts of gay Titania, \n To the blue dwelling of divine Urania: \n One, who, of late, had ta'en sweet forest walks \n With him who elegantly chats, and talks--\n The wrong'd Libertas,--who has told you stories \n Of laurel chaplets, and Apollo’s glories; \n Of troops chivalrous prancing through a city, \n And tearful ladies made for love, and pity: \n With many else which I have never known. \n Thus have I thought; and days on days have flown \n Slowly, or rapidly--unwilling still \n For you to try my dull, unlearned quill. \n Nor should I now, but that I've known you long; \n That you first taught me all the sweets of song: \n The grand, the sweet, the terse, the free, the fine; \n What swell'd with pathos, and what right divine: \n Spenserian vowels that elope with ease, \n And float along like birds o'er summer seas; \n Miltonian storms, and more, Miltonian tenderness; \n Michael in arms, and more, meek Eve’s fair slenderness. \n Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly \n Up to its climax and then dying proudly? \n Who found for me the grandeur of the ode, \n Growing, like Atlas, stronger from its load? \n Who let me taste that more than cordial dram, \n The sharp, the rapier-pointed epigram? \n Shew'd me that epic was of all the king, \n Round, vast, and spanning all like Saturn's ring? \n You too upheld the veil from Clio's beauty, \n And pointed out the patriot's stern duty; \n The might of Alfred, and the shaft of Tell; \n The hand of Brutus, that so grandly fell \n Upon a tyrant's head. Ah! had I never seen, \n Or known your kindness, what might I have been? \n What my enjoyments in my youthful years, \n Bereft of all that now my life endears? \n And can I e'er these benefits forget? \n And can I e'er repay the friendly debt? \n No, doubly no;--yet should these rhymings please, \n I shall roll on the grass with two-fold ease: \n For I have long time been my fancy feeding \n With hopes that you would one day think the reading \n Of my rough verses not an hour mis[s]pent; \n Should it e'er be so, what a rich content! \n Some weeks have pass'd since last I saw the spires \n In lucent Thames reflected:—warm desires \n To see the sun o'er peep the eastern dimness, \n And morning shadows streaking into slimness \n Across the lawny fields, and pebbly water; \n To mark the time as they grow broad, and shorter; \n To feel the air that plays about the hills, \n And sips its freshness from the little rills; \n To see high, golden corn wave in the light \n When Cynthia smiles upon a summer's night, \n And peers among the cloudlet's jet and white, \n As though she were reclining in a bed \n Of bean blossoms, in heaven freshly shed. \n No sooner had I stepp'd into these pleasures \n Than I began to think of rhymes and measures: \n The air that floated by me seem’d to say \n 'Write! thou wilt never have a better day.' \n And so I did. When many lines I’d written, \n Though with their grace I was not oversmitten, \n Yet, as my hand was warm, I thought I’d better \n Trust to my feelings, and write you a letter. \n Such an attempt required an inspiration \n Of a peculiar sort,--a consummation;--\n Which, had I felt, these scribblings might have been \n Verses from which the soul would never wean: \n But many days have past since last my heart \n Was warm’d luxuriously by divine Mozart; \n By Arne delighted, or by Handel madden'd; \n Or by the song of Erin pierc’d and sadden'd: \n What time you were before the music sitting, \n And the rich notes to each sensation fitting. \n Since I have walk'd with you through shady lanes \n That freshly terminate in open plains, \n And revel'd in a chat that ceased not \n When at night-fall among your books we got: \n No, nor when supper came, nor after that,--\n Nor when reluctantly I took my hat; \n No, nor till cordially you shook my hand \n Mid-way between our homes:--your accents bland \n Still sounded in my ears, when I no more \n Could hear your footsteps touch the grav’ly floor. \n Sometimes I lost them, and then found again; \n You chang'd the footpath for the grassy plain. \n In those still moments I have wish'd you joys \n That well you know to honour:--'Life's very toys \n 'With him,' said I, 'will take a pleasant charm; \n 'It cannot be that ought will work him harm.' \n These thoughts now come o’er me with all their might:-- \n Again I shake your hand,--friend Charles, good night.\n And what is love? It is a doll dress’d up \n For idleness to cosset, nurse, and dandle; \n A thing of soft misnomers, so divine \n That silly youth doth think to make itself \n Divine by loving, and so goes on \n Yawning and doting a whole summer long, \n Till Miss’s comb is made a pearl tiara, \n And common Wellingtons turn Romeo boots; \n Then Cleopatra lives at number seven, \n And Antony resides in Brunswick Square. \n Fools! if some passions high have warm’d the world, \n If Queens and Soldiers have play’d deep for hearts, \n It is no reason why such agonies \n Should be more common than the growth of weeds. \n Fools! make me whole again that weighty pearl \n The Queen of Egypt melted, and I’ll say \n That ye may love in spite of beaver hats. \n The Poetry of earth is never dead:    \n When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,    \n And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run    \n From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;    \n That is the Grasshopper’s—he takes the lead       \n In summer luxury,—he has never done    \n With his delights; for when tired out with fun    \n He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.    \n The poetry of earth is ceasing never:    \n On a lone winter evening, when the frost      \n Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills    \n The Cricket’s song, in warmth increasing ever,    \n And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,    \n The Grasshopper’s among some grassy hills.\n Souls of Poets dead and gone, \n What Elysium have ye known, \n Happy field or mossy cavern, \n Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern? \n Have ye tippled drink more fine \n Than mine host's Canary wine? \n Or are fruits of Paradise \n Sweeter than those dainty pies \n Of venison? O generous food! \n Drest as though bold Robin Hood \n Would, with his maid Marian, \n Sup and bowse from horn and can.\n I have heard that on a day \n Mine host's sign-board flew away, \n Nobody knew whither, till \n An astrologer's old quill \n To a sheepskin gave the story, \n Said he saw you in your glory, \n Underneath a new old sign \n Sipping beverage divine, \n And pledging with contented smack \n The Mermaid in the Zodiac.  \n Souls of Poets dead and gone, \n What Elysium have ye known, \n Happy field or mossy cavern, \n Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern?\n O Goddess! hear these tuneless numbers, wrung \n By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear, \n And pardon that thy secrets should be sung \n Even into thine own soft-conched ear: \n Surely I dreamt to-day, or did I see \n The winged Psyche with awaken'd eyes? \n I wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly, \n And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise, \n Saw two fair creatures, couched side by side \n In deepest grass, beneath the whisp'ring roof \n Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran \n A brooklet, scarce espied:\n Mid hush'd, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed, \n Blue, silver-white, and budded Tyrian, \n They lay calm-breathing, on the bedded grass; \n Their arms embraced, and their pinions too; \n Their lips touch'd not, but had not bade adieu, \n As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber, \n And ready still past kisses to outnumber \n At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love: \n The winged boy I knew; \n But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove? \n His Psyche true! \n O latest born and loveliest vision far \n Of all Olympus' faded hierarchy! \n Fairer than Phoebe's sapphire-region'd star, \n Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky; \n Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none, \n Nor altar heap'd with flowers; \n Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan \n Upon the midnight hours; \n No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet \n From chain-swung censer teeming; \n No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat \n Of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming.\n O brightest! though too late for antique vows, \n Too, too late for the fond believing lyre, \n When holy were the haunted forest boughs, \n Holy the air, the water, and the fire; \n Yet even in these days so far retir'd \n From happy pieties, thy lucent fans, \n Fluttering among the faint Olympians, \n I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspir'd. \n So let me be thy choir, and make a moan \n Upon the midnight hours; \n Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet \n From swinged censer teeming; \n Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat \n Of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming. \n Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane \n In some untrodden region of my mind, \n Where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain, \n Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind: \n Far, far around shall those dark-cluster'd trees \n Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep; \n And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees, \n The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull'd to sleep; \n And in the midst of this wide quietness \n A rosy sanctuary will I dress \n With the wreath'd trellis of a working brain, \n With buds, and bells, and stars without a name, \n With all the gardener Fancy e'er could feign, \n Who breeding flowers, will never breed the same: \n And there shall be for thee all soft delight \n That shadowy thought can win, \n A bright torch, and a casement ope at night, \n To let the warm Love in! \n Ever let the Fancy roam, \n Pleasure never is at home: \n At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth, \n Like to bubbles when rain pelteth; \n Then let winged Fancy wander \n Through the thought still spread beyond her: \n Open wide the mind's cage-door, \n She'll dart forth, and cloudward soar. \n O sweet Fancy! let her loose; \n Summer's joys are spoilt by use, \n And the enjoying of the Spring \n Fades as does its blossoming; \n Autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too, \n Blushing through the mist and dew, \n Cloys with tasting: What do then? \n Sit thee by the ingle, when \n The sear faggot blazes bright, \n Spirit of a winter's night; \n When the soundless earth is muffled, \n And the caked snow is shuffled \n From the ploughboy's heavy shoon; \n When the Night doth meet the Noon \n In a dark conspiracy \n To banish Even from her sky. \n Sit thee there, and send abroad, \n With a mind self-overaw'd, \n Fancy, high-commission'd:—send her! \n She has vassals to attend her: \n She will bring, in spite of frost, \n Beauties that the earth hath lost; \n She will bring thee, all together, \n All delights of summer weather; \n All the buds and bells of May, \n From dewy sward or thorny spray; \n All the heaped Autumn's wealth, \n With a still, mysterious stealth: \n She will mix these pleasures up \n Like three fit wines in a cup, \n And thou shalt quaff it:—thou shalt hear \n Distant harvest-carols clear; \n Rustle of the reaped corn; \n Sweet birds antheming the morn: \n And, in the same moment, hark! \n 'Tis the early April lark, \n Or the rooks, with busy caw, \n Foraging for sticks and straw. \n Thou shalt, at one glance, behold \n The daisy and the marigold; \n White-plum'd lillies, and the first \n Hedge-grown primrose that hath burst; \n Shaded hyacinth, alway \n Sapphire queen of the mid-May; \n And every leaf, and every flower \n Pearled with the self-same shower. \n Thou shalt see the field-mouse peep \n Meagre from its celled sleep; \n And the snake all winter-thin \n Cast on sunny bank its skin; \n Freckled nest-eggs thou shalt see \n Hatching in the hawthorn-tree, \n When the hen-bird's wing doth rest \n Quiet on her mossy nest; \n Then the hurry and alarm \n When the bee-hive casts its swarm; \n Acorns ripe down-pattering, \n While the autumn breezes sing. \n Oh, sweet Fancy! let her loose; \n Every thing is spoilt by use: \n Where's the cheek that doth not fade, \n Too much gaz'd at? Where's the maid \n Whose lip mature is ever new? \n Where's the eye, however blue, \n Doth not weary? Where's the face \n One would meet in every place? \n Where's the voice, however soft, \n One would hear so very oft? \n At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth \n Like to bubbles when rain pelteth. \n Let, then, winged Fancy find \n Thee a mistress to thy mind: \n Dulcet-ey'd as Ceres' daughter, \n Ere the God of Torment taught her \n How to frown and how to chide; \n With a waist and with a side \n White as Hebe's, when her zone \n Slipt its golden clasp, and down \n Fell her kirtle to her feet, \n While she held the goblet sweet \n And Jove grew languid.—Break the mesh \n Of the Fancy's silken leash; \n Quickly break her prison-string \n And such joys as these she'll bring.— \n Let the winged Fancy roam, \n Pleasure never is at home.\"",
